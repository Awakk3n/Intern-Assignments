        "In this assignment, you'll continue building on the previous assignment to predict the price of a house using information like its location, area, no. of rooms etc. You'll use the dataset from the [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) competition on [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com).\n",
